# Prime Factor Detector in C++

## Overview
This repository hosts a C++ program that efficiently computes the prime factors of a given number. The program prompts the user to enter a number and then outputs its prime factors, leveraging optimized algorithms to ensure quick and accurate calculations.

## Features
- Prompt user input for number factorization.
- Calculation of prime factors for any integer.
- Output the prime factors in ascending order.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- A modern C++ compiler capable of C++11 or later (GCC or Clang recommended).
- Basic knowledge of command-line operations.

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/mht83/PrimeFactorDetectorCpp.git
2. Navigate to the project directory:
cd PrimeFactorDetectorCpp
3. Compile the program using a C++ compiler:
g++ -std=c++11 -o PrimeFactorDetector main.cpp

### Usage
Execute the compiled program:
./PrimeFactorDetector
Follow the on-screen prompts to enter a number and receive its prime factors.

## Contributing
Contributions to improve the program are welcome. Please feel free to fork the repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request.
